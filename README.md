# Hi there! 👋  

I'm Dima, a backend developer who mostly works with Python but likes to experiment with other tools and tech from time to time.  

## Currently  

I work at Tochka Bank and contribute to open-source projects whenever I can. I enjoy  exploring ways to make developer experience better.  

## My main projects  

Here are a few libraries I built for Taskiq:  

* [taskiq-postgres](https://github.com/danfimov/taskiq-postgres) — PostgreSQL integration for Taskiq;  
* [taskiq-ydb](https://github.com/danfimov/taskiq-ydb) — YDB integration for Taskiq;  
* [taskiq-dashboard](https://github.com/danfimov/taskiq-dashboard) — a small admin panel for Taskiq, inspired by Celery Flower.  

Some of my older projects from my time at Yandex:  

* [django-tinymce4-plus](https://github.com/danfimov/django-tinymce4-plus) — WYSIWYG editor integration for Django;  
* [ya_tracker_client](https://github.com/danfimov/ya_tracker_client) — Python client for the Yandex Tracker API.
